## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?

- It was challenging understanding the composition and relationships between these files for the bigger picture
- It was challenging remembering & re-reading the documentation and how to use Java's LinkedList
- Interesting: The topic itself is very cool! I never thought about how spell checkers could be made and programmed. I always assumed some magic but now that this assignment has broken it down so methodically, I can understand more about stuff like autocomplete/autocorrect.
